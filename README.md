### Abstract:

In the wake of current smart devices improving dramatically, the campus's traditional infrastructure is not satisfied with teachers and student requirements. Information constructions at colleges have transferred from digitalized campus to intelligence campus. Intelligence campus is the development trend of education information construction, especially the widespread application of wireless sensors and internet things technology. The development and promotion of the internet of things, mobile learning equipment, wireless network equipment, and smart software have greatly improved intelligent campus applications. The technology of data and the internet of things helps all students and faculty instructors achieve more efficient teaching and research tasks. The construction of a more efficient education ecosystem is the goal to explore wireless sensor and internet things technology in smart campus and propose a development strategy from smart campus to efficient intelligence campus construction.
